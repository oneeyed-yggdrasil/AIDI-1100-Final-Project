## 1. Scan/Parse
a. Scan and parse news from “newswire” website below. https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/news-releases-list

We have taken the stock symbols of two Companies namely, **Paramount Global(PARA)** and **PureCycle Technologies, Inc.(PCT)** for this project from www.prnewswire.com website.

1. Paramount Global (PARA) reference - https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paramount-global-reports-third-quarter-earnings-results-301976217.html

2. PureCycle Technologies, Inc.(PCT) reference - https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pct-investors-have-opportunity-to-lead-purecycle-technologies-inc-securities-fraud-lawsuit-301995149.html

## 2. Track/Store/Search
a. Keep track of the news by storing the parsed news somewhere (CSV, DF, DB, EXCEL, anything else)

b. For all parsed news, search the content of the tracked news to find at least 2-3 stock symbols in a specific industry of your
choice; e.g: (TSX: TSLA); (TSX: GM)

## 3. Retrieve Data (Web (API))
a. Scan Yahoo! Finance page for the stock symbols that appeared in the news (there should be a module for yahoo finance that
you can use instead of looking for webpage content).

b. Capture/retrieve the stock price and volume for last 30 days.

## 4.  Visualize
a. Prepare colourful visualization/graphs showing stock prices for last 30 days.

i. Visualization should be a plot (time - series) for:
1. Volume
2. Daily Close Price
